# Neural Network on ESP
Started this project to run a neural network on the ESP32 using plain C++—no libraries, no fancy stuff, just straightforward coding. Why? Because a bit of challenge is always fun!

The idea of running neural networks on C++ is already pretty wild, and trying to optimise it to run on an ESP32? That’s a whole new level of crazy. But hey, I’ve got bigdawgs on blast, so let’s see where this goes!

It’s still in progress, so don’t expect miracles just yet. Updates will come as we make headway, or when I figure out why my ESP32 isn’t turning into a supercomputer.

If you're an expert in C++ or just love taking on crazy ideas, feel free to contribute! Let's connect, share ideas, and maybe figure out how to get this neural net to cooperate.
